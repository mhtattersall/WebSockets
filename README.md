# WebSockets

The Word document contains notes on Web Sockets from the MIT xPro Data Engineering Certificate.  
Server.py and Client.py are progams to demonstrate Web Sockets.   
Start Server.py in the terminal, then Client.py in another terminal.
See https://github.com/johntango/Streaming for a further example.
